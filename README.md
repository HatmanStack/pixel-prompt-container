# Pixel Prompt Containerized

This repository contains a static React Native application built using Expo with FastApi and Docker for deployment. It's a single container that's running [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Hatman/react-native-serve-ml).  It's serving several diffusion models that use the huggingface [inference-api](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index). The root repository and alternative deployments are [here](https://github.com/HatmanStack/react-native-serve-ml). A blog post explaining this deployment and the HuggingFace Inference API can be found [here](https://medium.com/@HatmanStack/cloud-bound-hugging-face-spaces-1101c569690d).

## Installation

To generate the static content for this container have a working Node/npm installation and clone the [pixel-prompt-frontend](https://github.com/HatmanStack/pixel-prompt-frontend) repo.  Run these commands in the pixel-prompt-frontend root directory to generate static content.

```shell
npm install -g yarn
yarn
npx expo export:web
```

Static files are output to the web-build folder in the root directory. Move the web-build folder to your pixel-prompt-container root directory. This allows the application to be deployed as a single container. The included web-build uses port 7860. **In a container to reach the endpoint from the frontend use "http://localhost:<port>/api" in the pixel-prompt-frontend. Set your port in the dockerfile when configuring uvicorn.** 

Add your HF_TOKEN variable as an environmental variable in your container settings.
